## 🎯 Overview

This project leverages state-of-the-art **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automatically classify weld defects from images, revolutionizing quality control in manufacturing and industrial applications. The system provides both binary classification (Good/Defective) and detailed multi-class defect categorization.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **Deep Learning Powered** - Custom CNN architecture built with PyTorch
- 🎯 **Multi-Class Classification** - Identifies 6 distinct defect types
- 🌐 **Interactive Web Interface** - Real-time classification via Streamlit
- 📊 **Comprehensive Evaluation** - Detailed metrics and performance analysis
- ⚡ **Real-Time Processing** - Fast inference for production environments
- 🔄 **End-to-End Pipeline** - From training to deployment

## 🔍 Defect Categories

| Class | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| ✅ **Good Weld** | High-quality, defect-free welds | Production ready |
| 🔥 **Burn Through** | Excessive heat causing material burn | Structural weakness |
| 🧪 **Contamination** | Foreign material in weld zone | Reduced integrity |
| ❌ **Lack of Fusion** | Incomplete bonding between materials | Critical failure risk |
| ⚠️ **Misalignment** | Poor positioning of weld components | Aesthetic/structural issues |
| 🔽 **Lack of Penetration** | Insufficient weld depth | Weak joint strength |

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

Our CNN architecture is specifically designed for weld defect classification:

```
Input (224x224x3) 
    ↓
Conv2D + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout
    ↓
MaxPooling2D
    ↓
[Multiple Conv Blocks]
    ↓
Global Average Pooling
    ↓
Fully Connected Layers
    ↓
Output (6 classes)
```

### 🔧 Key Components
